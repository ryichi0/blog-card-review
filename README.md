## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Hover pseudo class



### Continued development

i think i may continue learning html tags, because it was challenging for me to use them in order to structure my text-based content.
and also a deep focus on media queries.
